- it loads along with html parsing and then it pause the html parsing
  and execute the script and then html parsing continues
  defer
- html parses, whn it sees a script tag it doesnt pause html parsing
- it loads along with html parsing and once html parsing completed, it will
  execute the script tag

When to use what?

- when one script is dependent on other, dont go for async, bcoz it doesnt
  guarantee the execution flow. It is better to go with defer.
- when scripts are independent go for async.
