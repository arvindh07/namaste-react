1. What is CDN?
-- It is used to deliver content quickly as it serves near to the location of the user, rather than going
to the server for request which is located some where very far wrt to the user.
-- It is a group of distributed servers that provides cached internet content from a network closest to the
user to speed up the delivery.

2. What is crossorigin in script tag?
-- it is used to request content from other servers or origins
-- share resources from one domain to another

3. Async and defer attribute
-- there are three ways to load and execute js in browsers - normal, async, defer 
normal
    - html parses, whn it sees a script tag it pauses html parsing
    - it loads and executes script tag and then html parsing continues
async
    - html parses, whn it sees a script tag it doesnt pauses html parsing
    - it loads along with html parsing and then it pause the html parsing 
    and execute the script and then html parsing continues
defer
    - html parses, whn it sees a script tag it doesnt pause html parsing
    - it loads along with html parsing and once html parsing completed, it will 
    execute the script tag

When to use what?
- when one script is dependent on other, dont go for async, bcoz it doesnt
guarantee the execution flow. It is better to go with defer.
- when scripts are independent go for async.
