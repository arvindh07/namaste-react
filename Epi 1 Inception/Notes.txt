Episode 1 - Inception

- we will write basic hello world using html
- we will write heading hello world using js
- we will try to write hello world using react
    -- for this we will be using CDN
- we got two cdn links react and reactDom

Why we need to separate cdn links instead of just one?
- react is not just for browsers it works in mobile like react native etc
- react cdn is the core code base of react
- react dom cdn is the connecting bridge b/w react and dom. It is used to manipulate dom.

Create react hello world
- first creayte element using react core cdn
- React.createElement()
- then create root element to render our react code. This comes from reactDom.
- ReactDom.createRoot()
- then render the element inside root.
- root.render(element)

CreateElement and render
- what does createElement returns -- it returns me a react element which is ultimately a js object
- later render method converts those react elements into html code
- imagine nested elements, writing code will become more monotonous and clumsy.
- that is why JSX is used.

DOM manipulation
- it is one of the costliest operation performed by browser.

React is a library not a framework
- it can be executed in a independent place of our app whether it is header or footer...it doesnt matter
- where framework comes with a full fledged syntax and rules.
