Epi 2 Igniting the app

Our previous epi code is not production ready bcoz
- it needs to minified, image optimization, remove comments and lot of things
- for the above requirements, we need library or packages

NPM 
- it is used to manage packages
- react by default comes with NPM
- we can create npm by doing npm init
- it will create a package.json file -> it is like congfig file for npm
- package === dependencies

We got npm, wht dependencies we gonna install now?? ---Bundler
- html,css,js needs to be compressed, minified, cleaned etc
- bundler does the job of it
- vite, parcel, webpack are examples of bundler
- create-react-app uses webpack and babel to build our code ready for production

In our app, we will be using parcel
- do npm install -D parcel

package-lock.json and node_modules
- aftr install, our directory will contain 2 new files
- package-lock maintains the exact version of our dependencies
- node_modules will contain all the dependencied code fetched from npm repository

Scenerio
- npm i chalk:^5.3.0(latest)
- package-lock.json will be created with chalk:5.3.0
later if we delete node_modules and lock file, and change pkg file as chalk:^5.2.0
- thn give npm i, our lock file will have chalk:5.3.0, since ^ is thr, it will update to latest 
minor/patch version
- package and package-lock.json should be pushed to github repo

Git 
- whatevr u can regenerate dont put it on git eg: node_modules 
- using package.json and package-lock.json, we can regenerate node_modules
