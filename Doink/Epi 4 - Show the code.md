# Epi 4 - Talk is cheap, show the code🚀🚀

## How to build a website??

- First thing is PLANNINGGGG🤔🤔
- Planning is the key. If u plan well, coding is super easy.😉

## Planning

- simple wireframe/ui mock in paper (or) online wireframe editor.
- low level design( breaking down into components)
  For eg:
- Header
     - Logo
     - Nav items
- Body
     - Search
     - Restaurant container
       -- Restro card
- Footer
     - Copyright
     - Links
     - Address
     - Contact

## props

- is like a arg to a function, to make it as a dynamic.

## config driven ui

- it is controlling ui using config/data.🤞
- for eg: swiggy -> they might have offers based on places. So, by config or data they are displaying
  the respective ui based on their place.
- and the config comes from backend.⭐
- for eg: if u wanna have red background for delhi, yellow background for chennai etc. all these will
  come from config, which is nothing but data coming from backend.🚀
- here comes the purpose of config driven ui, to build ui based on config/data.
- ui layer + data layer makes frontend app.

## cdn

- we can use cdn to store images and display using that url🚀

## key in map

- if we dont add that unique identifier, react will render all components bcoz it doesnt knw the 
diff bw them🤞
- it helps in huge optimisation.
- dont use indexes as key(react recommends)❌
