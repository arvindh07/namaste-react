# Epi 10 - Tailwind css

## sass

- it is like superpower with css
- but it is recommended way in industry standards❌❌

## styled components

- it is one of the standards followed in big companies✅

## tailwind css install

- npm i tailwindcss postcss
- postcss -- a tool for transforming css with js⭕
- tailwindcss uses postcss in background⭐
- our bundler like parcel uses postcss to understand tailwind css😁
- tailwind is light weight and bundles it small. For eg, if we write "m-4" in 10 places, it will just import 
it only one time🔥
- it will import only the css that we used. eg, if we dont use box shadow, it wont import🚀

## cons

- make our component file ugly whn thr is a large number of css classes🤦‍♂️
